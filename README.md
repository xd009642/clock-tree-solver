# clock-tree-solver

This is my attempt to create a tool to define a clock tree and constraints on it
and choose the optimal parameters. Often MCU vendors release their own tools for
different chips so why not have one tool. 

This is being developed as a library and binary so there may be potential to use
this and a `build.rs` file to automatically generate your clock initialisation
code...
